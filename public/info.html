            <main>                                                 <!--the main page below, filled with Coronavirus information.-->
                <h2>Coronavirus(COVID-19) information</h2>
				<p>Coronaviruses are a type of virus. There are lots of different types and some can cause disease. SARS-CoV-2, 
				a new type of coronavirus has caused this worldwide pandemic of a respiratory disease, called COVID-19. This illness can very easily be spread from person to person;
				below are the two main ways <strong>YOU</strong> can help slow the spread as well as information for people at higher risk.</p>
                <h3>Social-distancing & advice for going out in public</h3>
				<p>You don't have to have symptoms to be infected with the virus and potentially spread it. 
				Here is a list of things you can do in public to reduce the probability of spreading Coronavirus.</p>
				
					<dl>
                        <dt>Stay at least 2 metres away from anyone you don't live with. </dt>
                        <dt>Wash your hands often.</dt>
                        <dt>Use hand sanitiser if its available.</dt>
                        <dt>When you cough or sneeze, cover your mouth and nose with a tissue or your sleeve(NOT your hands).</dt>
						<dt>Put tissues in the bin immediately after use and wash your hands</dt>
						<dt>AVOID touching your eyes nose or mouth wherever possible</dt>
                    </dl>
					<br>
               <h3>Self Isolation</h3>
				<p> Self Isolation is when you do not leave your home because you have, or think you might have coronavirus(COVID-19). This is to prevent spreading the virus to others.</p>

		<h3>Advice for people at high risk </h3>
		<p> If you're classed as high risk(vulnerable to the virus), you should be even more cautious. 
		This is because it is extremely dangerous for a vulnerable person to contract coronavirus.
		If you are classed as vulnerable you should :</p>
		
		<dl id="shield">
		<dt>Not have visitors</dt>
		<dd>You shouldn't have any visitors unless you have formed a <em>support bubble</em> with them.</dd>
		<dt>Not leave for food or medicine</dt> 
		<dd>You should shop online or ask family/friends to collect shopping for you.<dd>
		<dt>Not go to work</dt>
		<dd>Stay at home even if working from home isn't possible. You can use the letter you'll receive as proof you cant go to work.(You may be eligible for Stutory Sick pay).</dd>
		<dt>Let your children go to school</dt> 
		<dd>Finally if you have children, you should still allow them to go to school unless they are also classed as vulnerable.
		</dl>
